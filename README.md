### First approach

In this project the subject of study is the crowd dynamics evacuation scenarios. In the context of collective behavior we will offer a fuzzy logic-based framework to comprehensively describe the behavior of crowds during evacuations. The framework is designed to accommodate the diverse intentions of both pedestrians and assailants during such scenarios. It categorizes pedestrians into three groups based on their interaction with assailants, and their individual behaviors are determined through a fusion of local obstacle-avoidance responses, regional path-searching strategies, and global goal-seeking actions. The crucial aspect is that the weighting factors for these components are dynamically adjusted based on the perceptual information acquired through complex interactions with the surrounding environment. 
To further delve into crowd behavior, we will explore various alternative approaches to enhance our understanding of the subject. These approaches will involve investigating different possibilities for analyzing and modeling crowd dynamics in various scenarios.


### Timeline

- Firs report (20/11/2023)

Following the structure of the provided template, in this first submission, we will offer a general description of the problem and its concepts. Furthermore, we will explore the related work that has been done up to this point and some of the models currently used for addressing the challenge of crowd evacuation.This analysis will guide us in formulating our strategy for addressing this problem, which we will implement in the next submission.
    
- Second report (18/12/2023)
    
In our second report, we will focus on refining our initial submission based on the feedback we received. In addition to this, we will delve even deeper into the details of the proposed verification methodology and models.

By that time, we also hope to have made significant progress in implementing our approach.

- Final report (8/1/2024)
    
It must be based on a polished version of previous reports. The introduction must be concise, mention relevant existing research and use supporting research to present the problem, as well as reasons why you deem your solution to be of impact. It should be written in a narrative form, leading towards you thesis. The methods section must present details about your approach as well as the methodology employed for evaluation. Again it should be concise and provide enough details that one could reimplement your solution. The results section should include some form of a comparison with previous research. In the discussion  section discuss your results in view of previous research and provide some ideas for future work. Follow the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) architecture for scientific writing. Keep the manuscript concise. Prepare the report with the provided template. Reports should be written in English. The page limit for the final report is 4 pages. It must not exceed 2000 words. Quality is paramount; be mindful of your grammar, do spellchecking. Think of your finished undergraduate thesis. Individual contributions of the authors must be specified (i.e. "JN wrote the introduction and polished the language, MK performed the data analysis and prepared the images, IC implemented algorithm A and ran the experiments").
