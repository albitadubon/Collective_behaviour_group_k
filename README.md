### Starting point

In this project the subject of study is the crowd dynamics evacuation scenarios. In the context of collective behavior we will offer a fuzzy logic-based framework to comprehensively describe the behavior of crowds during evacuations. The framework is designed to accommodate the diverse intentions of both pedestrians and assailants during such scenarios. It categorizes pedestrians into three groups based on their interaction with assailants, and their individual behaviors are determined through a fusion of local obstacle-avoidance responses, regional path-searching strategies, and global goal-seeking actions. The crucial aspect is that the weighting factors for these components are dynamically adjusted based on the perceptual information acquired through complex interactions with the surrounding environment. 
To further delve into crowd behavior, we will explore various alternative approaches to enhance our understanding of the subject. These approaches will involve investigating different possibilities for analyzing and modeling crowd dynamics in various scenarios.


### Plan

- First report (20/11/2023)

Following the structure of the provided template, in this first submission, we will offer a general description of the problem and its concepts. Furthermore, we will explore the related work that has been done up to this point and some of the models currently used for addressing the challenge of crowd evacuation.This analysis will guide us in formulating our strategy for addressing this problem, which we will implement in the next submission.
    
- Second report (18/12/2023)
    
In our second report, we will focus on refining our initial submission based on the feedback we received. In addition to this, we will delve even deeper into the details of the proposed verification methodology and models.

By that time, we also hope to have made significant progress in implementing our approach.

- Final report (8/1/2024)
    
The final report for this project will serve as a culmination of our previous work, aiming to produce a refined and comprehensive document. We will present meticulous details about our approach and evaluation methodology within the methods section. Going beyond mere data presentation, the results section will include a comparative analysis with prior research, highlighting the distinctive contributions of our proposed approach. In the discussion section, we will delve into the implications of our findings within the broader context of existing research, providing insights and laying out avenues for future work. This report is a testament to the progress we've made, with continuous improvements made based on feedback received throughout the course.
