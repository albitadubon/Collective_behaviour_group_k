First approach
    In this project the subject of study is the crowd dynamics evacuation scenarios. In the context of collective behavior we will offer a fuzzy logic-based framework to comprehensively describe the behavior of crowds during evacuations. The framework is designed to accommodate the diverse intentions of both pedestrians and assailants during such scenarios. It categorizes pedestrians into three groups based on their interaction with assailants, and their individual behaviors are determined through a fusion of local obstacle-avoidance responses, regional path-searching strategies, and global goal-seeking actions. The crucial aspect is that the weighting factors for these components are dynamically adjusted based on the perceptual information acquired through complex interactions with the surrounding environment. 
To further delve into crowd behavior, we will explore various alternative approaches to enhance our understanding of the subject. These approaches will involve investigating different possibilities for analyzing and modeling crowd dynamics in various scenarios.


Write a rough sketch of what you plan to do during the course (plan with respect to the 3 report deadlines)
  - Deadline 1: Milestone 1

    Present a review of concepts and existing models, present a general overview of the problem and provide an idea of how you intend to approach to solve the          problem. Follow the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) architecture for scientific writing. Prepare the report with the provided template.       The page limit is 4 pages, but quality should be paramount; be mindful of your grammar, do spellchecking. Think of your finished undergraduate thesis.
    
  - Deadline 2: Milestone 2
    
    It should include polishing of the previous report based on the received comments, details about the methods and the proposed methodology for verification.         Follow the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) architecture for scientific writing. Prepare the report with the provided template (see first      report asignment). The page limit is 4 pages, but quality should be paramount; be mindful of your grammar, do spellchecking. Think of your finished                 undergraduate thesis. 

  - Deadline 3: Final milestone
    
    It must be based on a polished version of previous reports. The introduction must be concise, mention relevant existing research and use supporting research to     present the problem, as well as reasons why you deem your solution to be of impact. It should be written in a narrative form, leading towards you thesis. The       methods section must present details about your approach as well as the methodology employed for evaluation. Again it should be concise and provide enough          details that one could reimplement your solution. The results section should include some form of a comparison with previous research. In the discussion            section discuss your results in view of previous research and provide some ideas for future work. Follow the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results and              Discussion) architecture for scientific writing. Keep the manuscript concise. Prepare the report with the provided template. Reports should be written in           English. The page limit for the final report is 4 pages. It must not exceed 2000 words. Quality is paramount; be mindful of your grammar, do spellchecking.         Think of your finished undergraduate thesis. Individual contributions of the authors must be specified (i.e. "JN wrote the introduction and polished the            language, MK performed the data analysis and prepared the images, IC implemented algorithm A and ran the experiments").
